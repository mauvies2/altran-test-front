Once in the App, it is possible to see Brastlewark general information regarding its population.

Clicking on 'explore' allows you to explore further details about Brastlewark citizens, where some filters can also be applied.

Since the Gnomes are very modern and updated, they might want to download the App from the browser to their mobiles :). 
They can access the app through the following URL: https://competent-payne-6c41b3.netlify.app/ 
The App meet all Lighthouse (in chrome) requirements of a progressive web app (PWA)

## Development briefing

I used plain CSS with Sass, without the assistance of a library such as Bootstrap, to prove my frontend CSS and HTML capacities.

Within React, I decided to use functional components with hooks, since I thought the code could be cleaner and shorter. 
Due to simplicity, scope of App and time issues, I also did not find necessary to use Redux to manage states. 

Finally, my skills go beyond what is it shown in this App, however time was running and I am also currently working on my Ph.D Thesis and some other projects.
I really hope you like it and meet the requirements!
